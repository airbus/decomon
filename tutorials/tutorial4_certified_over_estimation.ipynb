    "In recent years, we have seen the emergence of safety-related properties for regression tasks in many industries. For example, numerical models have been developed to approximate the physical phenomena inherent in their systems. Since these models are based on physical equations, the relevance of which is affirmed by scientific experts, their qualifications are carried out without any problems.\n",
    " However, as their computational costs and execution time prevent us from embedding them, the use of these numerical models in the aeronautical domain remains mainly limited to the development and design phase of the aircraft. Thanks to the current success of deep neural networks, previous works have already studied neural network-based surrogates for the approximation of numerical models. Nevertheless, these surrogates have additional safety properties that need to be demonstrated to certification authorities. In this blog post, we will examine a specification that arises for a neural network used for take-off distance estimation which is the over-estimation of the simulation model. We will explore how to address them with _**decomon**_.\n",

    "so we need to build an approximation of these models that can be compatible with operational constraints,\n",
    "hardware constraints, and real-time constraints. \n",
    "Also, we need to prove that the decisions made by the system using the surrogate model \n",
